# Create true random seeds (near as we can tell) with your webcam.
#
# This script will use your webcam as a source of entropy. There is no need to
# point it at anything. The CCD in the camera is providing enough entropy via
# (sorted in order of most to least entropy):
# 
#   * Dark shot noise- Main source of entropy via thermal fluctuations
#   * Read noise- Sensor design producting electronic RF
#   * Photon shot noise- Noise via the arrival of a photon to the CCD
#   * Radiation noise- Alpha, beta, gamma, x-ray, and proton interaction
# 
# However, if you *really* want to point it at something chaotic, you could
# point the camera at:
#
#   * Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection
#   * Brownian motion
#   * Plasma globes
#   * Lava lamps
#   * Your ugly mug staring at the computer working
#
# At room temperature with no light, entropy is ~ 0.39 bits per byte
# Requires numpy & python-pycryptodome (https://www.pycryptodome.org/)
#
# Released to the public domain.
